Welcome to the land of unfinished side projects. Proceed at your own risk.

**WARNING!** Since the rollout of [my own Git service](https://src.edolg.net), I'm going to use GitHub much less. I keep this account just to interact with other people and their repositories. Maybe in future I'll mirror some of my repositories here to use GitHub's CI/CD and issue tracking services.

If you like my repositories, please [let me know](https://edolg.net/contacts)! I really appreciate it. In addition, if you also feel generous, please consider [making an offer](https://edolg.net/repos/donations).

Heard about [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) from me? Have a look at these:

- ["Plan 9 from Bell Labs" (4th ed.)](https://9p.io/sys/doc/9.pdf) This is the official research paper in PDF format of the final edition of Plan 9 from Bell Labs, at least officially.
- ["Plan 9: The Way the Future Was"](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/plan9.html) This page about Plan 9 is part of a greater work called [The Art of Unix Programming](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/index.html) by [Eric S. Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond).
- ["In praise of Plan 9"](https://drewdevault.com/2022/11/12/In-praise-of-Plan-9.html) An article about Plan 9 by [Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/).
- [9front](https://9front.org/) This is an unofficial continuation of Plan 9 from Bell Labs. It's the most active fork and brings lots of improvements, while still sticking with the philosophy that drove Plan 9's design. Its improvements span several areas, mainly bug fixing, hardware compatibility, and features. The project also maintains 2 forms of documentation: the [FQA (Frequently Questioned Answers)](https://fqa.9front.org/) (which is more of an overall manual about the operating system's installation and usage, as well as fairly enough of its theoretical background) and the [wiki](https://wiki.9front.org/) (which is more of a handbook for the practical stuff).
