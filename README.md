Welcome to the land of unfinished side projects. Proceed at your own risk.

## Me

Hi everyone, I'm an Italian man born in 2001. I know several programming languages and I started programming as self-taught back in 2015. For the past years I've been learning several programming languages but my favorite is [C90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C). I also like [Golang](https://go.dev/) a lot.

I like [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs), [9front](https://9front.org/) and all the related things. In fact, one day I would like to learn the [Rc shell](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/rc) and the [Plan 9 C dialect](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/programming/c_programming_in_plan_9). Plan 9 is by far the most underrated operating system.

"The most dangerous enemy of a better solution is an existing codebase that is just good enough."

Making code simple and reusable should be more important than adding features.
