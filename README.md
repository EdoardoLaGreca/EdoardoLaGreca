## About me

Hi everyone, I'm a (`<current_year> - 2001`) years old man who's interested in niche projects, either abandoned or still in active development. I know several programming languages, including: [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Go](https://golang.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and other languages that I learned during my course of studies. I started programming as self-taught back in 2015.

My favorite languages are C and Go.

I'm working on a webserver and soon(er or later) I will host my personal website with it. A link to that website will appear on both this README and my GitHub profile.

## Thoughts and unpopular opinions

[Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) is by far the most underrated operating system.
