## About me

Hi everyone, I'm a (`<current_year> - 2001`) years old Italian boy who's interested in niche projects, both abandoned and still in active development. I know [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and C (although I had some experience with other languages such as C#, Python and JavaScript). I'm currently learning [Go](https://golang.org/).

I'm the kind of guy who starts many projects and finishes less than half of them. However, I always try my best at finishing what I started.

I'm working on a webserver and soon(er or later) I will host my personal website with it. A link to that website will appear on both this README and my GitHub profile.

## My interests and opinions

My favorite parts of computer science are: low-level programming, optimization and operating systems (especially UNIX-like or UNIX-derived such as [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/)) as long as they are open source. Also, thanks to [Golang](https://golang.org/) and his majesty [Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike), I recently got interested in concurrency.

I somehow hate Microsoft and big tech companies which do not (or potentially may not) respect their users' privacy. Transparency should never be optional.

Even though I love open source software, I don't like either GNU software, because [GNU is bloat](http://9front.org/img/longcat.png), or its license (the GNU GPL license), because you cannot talk about freedom if you force using the same license for a derived software (which is basically what every copyleft license imposes).  
However, this does not mean that proprietary software shouldn't exist, I think it's still important to economically support developers.

I agree with most of what is written in [cat-v.org](cat-v.org), not everything though.

Beside computer science, I also like to play piano and listen to various music genres which are mainly electronic and lofi. My favorite artist(s) are Twenty One Pilots, which are an exception to the rule since they don't produce either electronic or lofi music.
