Welcome to the land of unfinished side projects. Proceed at your own risk.

**WARNING!** Since the rollout of [my personal Git hosting service](https://src.edolg.net), I'm going to use GitHub much less. I keep this account just to interact with other people and their repositories. Maybe in future I'll mirror some of my repositories here to use GitHub's services, like CI/CD and issue tracking.

Do you like my repositories? [Let me know!](https://edolg.net/contacts) I really appreciate it. In addition, if you feel generous, please consider [making an offer](https://edolg.net/repos/donations).

Heard about [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) from me? Did it spark some interest? Have a look at these:

- ["Plan 9 from Bell Labs" (4th ed.)](https://9p.io/sys/doc/9.pdf): The official research paper (PDF) of the final edition of Plan 9 from Bell Labs, at least officially.
- ["Plan 9: The Way the Future Was"](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/plan9.html): A page about Plan 9, part of a greater work called [The Art of Unix Programming](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/index.html) by [Eric S. Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond).
- ["In praise of Plan 9"](https://drewdevault.com/2022/11/12/In-praise-of-Plan-9.html): An article about Plan 9 by [Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/).
- [9front](https://9front.org/): An unofficial continuation of Plan 9 from Bell Labs. It's the most active fork and brings lots of improvements like bug fixing, hardware compatibility, and additional features, while still sticking with the philosophy that drove Plan 9's design. The project also maintains 2 forms of documentation: the [FQA (Frequently Questioned Answers)](https://fqa.9front.org/), which is more of an overall usage manual with some theoretical background, and the [wiki](https://wiki.9front.org/), which is more of a handbook for the practical stuff.
