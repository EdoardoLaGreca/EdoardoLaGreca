## About me

Hi everyone, I'm a (`<current_year> - 2001`) years old Italian boy who's interested in niche projects, both abandoned and still in active development. I know [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) (although I had some experience with other languages such as C#, Python and JavaScript). I'm currently learning [Go](https://golang.org/) and my favorite language is [C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99).

I'm the kind of guy who starts many projects and finishes less than half of them. However, I always try my best at finishing what I started.

I'm working on a webserver and soon(er or later) I will host my personal website with it. A link to that website will appear on both this README and my GitHub profile.

## My interests and opinions

I like many fields of computer science, such as operating systems (especially UNIX-like or UNIX-derived such as [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) or [NetBSD](https://netbsd.org/)) especially if they are open source. Also, thanks to [Golang](https://golang.org/) and his majesty [Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike), I recently got interested in concurrency.

I somehow hate Microsoft and big tech companies which do not (or potentially may not) respect their users' privacy. Transparency should never be optional.

I really like open source software, but I'm not against selling it, which is important to economically support developers.  
I don't like either GNU software, because [GNU is bloat](http://9front.org/img/longcat.png), or its license (the GNU GPL license), because you cannot talk about freedom if you force using the same license for a derived software (which is basically what every copyleft license imposes).  

I agree with most of what is written in [cat-v.org](cat-v.org), not everything though.

Beside computer science, I also like to play piano and listen to various music genres which are mainly electronic, [lofi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_music) and some [vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave) subgenres. My favorite artist(s) are [Twenty One Pilots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots), which are an exception to the rule since the songs they produce don't belong to any of the music genres I often listen to.
