Welcome to the land of unfinished side projects. Proceed at your own risk.

## About me

Hi there! My name's Edoardo, I'm an Italian man born in 2001. I can speak Italian natively and English as second language. I have a B1 certification but I can understand, speak and write as if I was B2-cerified. Whenever I get to choose which English dialect to use for writing and speaking, I prefer American (US) English.

The beginning of my programming journey dates back to summer 2015, when I learned my first programming language: Python. Now I know several languages, but my favorite and the one I'm more proficient in is C89.

In my free time I like to write little C89 programs that talk to each other using pipes. When I'm not programming, I usually learn interesting things on the internet. I have many project ideas in my head but when it's time to realize them they usually end up unfinished, because I either lose interest or don't have the required knowledge.

One day I'm going to learn [Plan 9 from Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) and [its C dialect](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/programming/c_programming_in_plan_9). I like the [Unix philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/philosophychapter.html) a lot!

## My opinions

 - Object-oriented programming tends to solve problems that don't exist and create problems that didn't exist.
 - [maybe a fact] The C programming language was never meant to be used for large programs, but rather small programs that communicate with each other.
