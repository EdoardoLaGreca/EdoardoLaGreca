## About me

Hi everyone, I'm a (<current_year> - 2001) years old Italian boy who's interested in niche projects, abandoned as well as still in active development. I mainly develop things in Rust, which is by far my favorite language although I also know C.

I'm the kind of guy who starts many projects and finishes less than half of them. However, I always try my best at finishing what I started.

I'm working on a webserver and soon(er or later) I will host my personal website with it. A link to that website will appear on both this README and my GitHub profile.

## My interests

My favorite parts of computer science are low-level programming, optimization and operating systems (especially UNIX-like) as long as they are open source.

I somehow hate Microsoft and big tech companies which do not respect their users' privacy. Transparency should never miss.

Even though **I love open source software**, I hate GNU (but less than big tech companies) because [GNU is bloat](http://9front.org/img/longcat.png) and I find that its license (the GNU GPL license) is kind of hypocritical. You may ask why, well... first: you need a lawyer to understand it and second: how can you talk about freedom if you have no freedom of choosing a different license for a software derived from a GPL-licensed one?

Beside computer science, I also like to play piano and listen to various music genres which are electronic and lofi mainly. My favorite artist(s) are Twenty One Pilots, which are an exception to the rule since they don't (mainly) produce electronic or lofi music.
