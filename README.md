Welcome to the land of unfinished side projects. Proceed at your own risk.

## Random facts

Hi everyone, I'm a (`<current_year> - 2001`) years old man who's interested in niche projects, either abandoned or still in active development. I know several programming languages, including: [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [Go](https://golang.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and other languages that I learned during my course of studies. I started programming as self-taught back in 2015.

My favorite languages are C and Go.

I'm learning the Rc shell by reading [this](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/rc) document and the Plan 9 C dialect by reading [this](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/programming/c_programming_in_plan_9) document.

[Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) is by far the most underrated operating system.

The most dangerous enemy of a better solution is an existing codebase that is just good enough.
