## About me

Hi everyone, I'm a (`<current_year> - 2001`) years old Italian boy who's interested in niche projects, both abandoned and still in active development. I know Rust and C (although I had experience with other languages like C#, Python and JavaScript). I'm currently learning Go.

I'm the kind of guy who starts many projects and finishes less than half of them. However, I always try my best at finishing what I started.

I'm working on a webserver and soon(er or later) I will host my personal website with it. A link to that website will appear on both this README and my GitHub profile.

## My interests

My favorite parts of computer science are low-level programming, optimization and operating systems (especially UNIX-like) as long as they are open source.

I somehow hate Microsoft and big tech companies which do not respect their users' privacy. Transparency should never be optional.

Even though I love open source software, I don't like GNU because [GNU is bloat](http://9front.org/img/longcat.png) and its license (the GNU GPL license) is kind of hypocritical for two reasons: 1. you need a lawyer to understand it and 2. you cannot talk about freedom if you have no freedom of choosing a different license for a derived software (which is basically what every copyleft license imposes).

I agree with _most_ of what [cat-v.org](cat-v.org) says about software. I said _most_ because I didn't read everything yet.

Beside computer science, I also like to play piano and listen to various music genres which are mainly electronic and lofi. My favorite artist(s) are Twenty One Pilots, which are an exception to the rule since they don't produce electronic or lofi music.
