Welcome to the land of unfinished side projects. Proceed at your own risk.

**WARNING!** Since the rollout of [my own Git service](https://src.edolg.net), I'm going to use this account much less. My most important repositories are going to be gradually moved there. I'm still going to use this account to interact with repositories hosted here by others and to mirror my own repositories in order to use GitHub's services, such as CI/CD.

If you like my repositories, please [let me know](https://edolg.net/contacts)! I really appreciate it. In addition, if you also feel generous, please consider [making an offer](https://edolg.net/repos/donations).

Heard about [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) from me? Have a look at these:
