## Me

Concatenating all this information into one written monologue would be boring to both write and read. Instead, I'll just drop it off here as a list. 

 - Italian
 - male
 - born in 2001
 - has started programming as self-taught in 2015
 - speaks Italian (native) and English (certified B1 but can understand, speak and write like B2)
 - knows several programming languages but prefers to use [C90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C), [Go](https://go.dev/) and [the Rc shell](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/rc)
 - actually prefers the [Plan 9 C dialect](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/programming/c_programming_in_plan_9) over C90
 - is learning [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and the [Plan 9 C dialect](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/programming/c_programming_in_plan_9)
 - really really really likes [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) (and [9front](https://9front.org/)), its philosophy and the [Unix philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/philosophychapter.html)
 - likes [minimalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism_(computing)) and [worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better)

"The most dangerous enemy of a better solution is an existing codebase that is just good enough."
